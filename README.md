WELCOME! 
There are lot of context aware, mobile applicationsin the market which work on weather. The purpose of most ofthese applications is to give information about current weatherand also for upcoming days. Most of these applications deliver lot of information like temperature, humidity, precipitation Etcetera, and some times this information could be overwhelming.Most people intend to use weather applications only for knowingthe climate(weather conditions)and not the values like tempera-ture, humidity or precipitation. Through this project, we intendto provide the user with the current climate without even openingthe weather application. We tried to achieve this task throughthe display of wallpaper(of the device). This project changes thewallpaper of the device based on the current climate of the placeevery few minutes or based on user preference.

In this project we implementedWeather Wallpaper, a con-text aware, mobile application which uses its current locationto  retrieve  the  information  about  current  climatic  conditionsand uses the information to download and display a wallpapermatching the same. There are mobile applications which workon weather conditions and also applications which work withwallpapers.  Ours  try  to  mix  the  both  features  and  present  it.This application can be further extended by adding the sometasks  mentioned  below.  currently,  we  download  and  displayimages related to only the present location, one can extend it toinclude images from different nearby sites. The application canalso be extended to also include and display information aboutthe current location(like historic importance, nearby places).
